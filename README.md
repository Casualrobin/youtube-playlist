# youtube-playlist

This project aims to provide a simple scrape which downloads all songs in a youtube playlist.
Ever had the annoying problem of revisiting a curated list of songs to find some of them have been taken down by the uploader? No longer!

# Testing

`unittest.main()` provides a command-line interface to the test script.
from root:
`python -m unittest Tests.X`
